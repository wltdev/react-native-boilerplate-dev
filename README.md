### Running your React Native application
```
npx react-native start
```

On another terminal, run npx react-native run-android:
```
npx react-native run-android
```

**npx react-native run-android** is one way to run your app - you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

> If you use the Yarn package manager, you can use yarn instead of npx when running React Native commands inside an existing project.
